# PatchGen
PatchGen is a prototype patch note generator I made for my Master Thesis 
"What did they do this time? How auto-mated patch notes can help make clearpatch notes for video games."

This generator takes the form of an Eclipse plugin for Java projects and allows users to automate parts of the patch note generation process.

Instructions will be provided once the prototype reaches a release state.


Note that this prototype may not be maintained after initial release.
